# fwtR
An app that allows comparison of tweets posted in two different trends of choice. 

App was mainly making text and emoji analysis. It could compare the usage of different words and word combinations and emojis between two different trends. It was also showing some stats about the people tweeting in the trends (e.g. when they created their accounts, how many tweets are from unique people in a given trend etc.). Also one could actually read the most popular tweets in a given trend. 

The purpose was mainly to expose the fake trends popping up in the chaotic political daily life of Turkey.

### Website

After the rtweet update now only the main page works. The new update changed which data the package gathered, which completely messes up my code. :(
